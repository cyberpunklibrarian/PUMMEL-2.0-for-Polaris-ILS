PUMMEL v2.0 - Processing Unclaimed Materials Mannual is Essentially Lame

This is an update of the original PUMMEL app and is written to work in conjunctin with the Polaris Integrated Library System (ILS). PUMMEL is a simple app that feeds keystrokes to Polaris ILS based upon the workflow needed to add a fee for unclaimed holds to a patron's account. This new version of PUMMEL has been rewritten to improve and update the workflow with Polaris 4.1R2 and higher along with adding new features not present in the original version.

PUMMEL 2.0 is written in AutoHotkey which can be had via:
www.autohotkey.com

PUMMEL 2.0:

* Works upon a standard user created in Polaris specifically for the purpose of processing unclaimed holds. (This enhances security and provides standardization.)

* Allows for processing of unclaimed holds from a text file full of item barcodes.

* Allows for check in of the items after processing and thus sending them on to the next patron or returning to shelf.

* Uses a mostly hands off approach to handling unclaims.

Usage suggestion:

0. Scan your unclaimed holds into a text file and save as barcodes.txt on the C drive. 

1. Launch PUMMEL 2.0.

2. Select branch. (Modified in code as needed.)

3. Select whether to check in after processing.

4. Click sumbit to set prefrences and launch Polaris ILS staff client.

5. Once fully launched, click Browse and select your barcodes.txt file.

6. Let it run. If you selected the check in option, PUMMEL 2.0 will stop and wait for you to click Ok to proceed.
